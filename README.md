## Sentiment Analysis on Airline Tweets Dataset
===============================================

### Project Overview  
The objective of this project is to apply sentiment analysis, the most common text classification
tool, to analyse an incoming message and tell whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative
or neutral. The dataset contains tweets on US Airlines of 2015. We applied some data preprocessing 
or wrangling techniques to remove unnecessary characters,symbols and tokens.Different machine learning
algorithms are used to bulild the models, evaluate the performance and make the predictions. Once 
the model is put into implementation, the business owner is able to predict whether the customers'
feedback is positve,negative and neutral. This can help identify potential issues in the process of 
corporate operations and improve customers' satisfaction.
